Odd Mechanical Angel has taken up the art of blogging as a way to show off her work as a writer including argumentative essays, short stories, poetry, and photojournalism. She is an aspiring young adult novelist currently working on her debut novel *Wind Lass*. OMA is interested in a variety of subjects and genres, especially fantasy fiction. Her favorite subgenres include steampunk, aviator punk, and anything with magic. Besides writing, OMA enjoys reading other people’s novels, taking artistic photographs, playing fantasy/science fiction video games, making art in general, and most activities that don’t require a lot of social interaction. She also enjoys drinking tea, preferably constantly, but definitely during any and all of these activities; sometimes she even makes a cup of tea so that she will have something to drink while she makes more tea.
